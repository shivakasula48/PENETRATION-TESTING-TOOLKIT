A Python-based command-line toolkit for performing basic penetration testing tasks, including:

* Port Scanning

* FTP Brute-Force Attacks

* Subdomain Enumeration

This tool is designed for ethical hacking exercises, cybersecurity training, and learning how various attacks work at a low level using Python.

## üß≠ Overview

This project provides a beginner-friendly but effective way to understand the fundamental stages of penetration testing: reconnaissance, scanning, and brute-force access attempts. Built entirely in Python, it is intended for use in controlled environments like CTFs, local VMs (e.g., Metasploitable), and educational labs (e.g., DVWA, OWASP Juice Shop).




## Features

1. **Port Scanner**
   - Scans a range of ports on a target IP or domain to identify open ports.
   - Multithreaded for faster results.

2. **Brute-Force Attack**
   - Performs a brute-force attack on FTP servers.
   - Uses a custom password list to test login credentials.

3. **Subdomain Finder**
   - Discovers subdomains for a given domain.
   - Utilizes a predefined list of common subdomains.
  
4. **Menu-Driven Interface**
   - Simple and interactive menu lets users easily select tools and input targets.
  
5. **Extensible Design**
   - Modular code structure allows for easy addition of future penetration testing components.

## How It Works

Each module is self-contained and follows a logical sequence:

1. **Port Scanner**
    * Uses the `socket` module to attempt TCP connections to ports.

    * Employs `ThreadPoolExecutor` for multi-threaded scanning.

    * Displays open ports only.

2. FTP Brute-Forcer
    * Uses the `ftplib` library to attempt login using credentials from a password file.

    * Stops immediately once valid credentials are found.

    * Handles connection failures and invalid inputs gracefully.

3. Subdomain Finder
    * Uses `dnspython` to resolve subdomains.

    * Attempts to resolve common subdomain prefixes (e.g., `www`, `mail`, `admin`).

    * Displays all successfully resolved domains.

## Requirements

Make sure you have Python 3.6 or later installed.

Install dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install dnspython
```

No additional libraries are required.

## Sample Output

### üîç Port Scanner

```sql
Enter target IP or domain: 192.168.1.1
Enter start port: 20
Enter end port: 100

Scanning 192.168.1.1 for open ports...

Port 21 is OPEN
Port 22 is OPEN

Open Ports Summary:
- Port 21
- Port 22
```

### üîê FTP Brute-Force

```yaml
Enter target IP: 192.168.1.1
Enter username: admin
Enter path to password file: passwords.txt

Trying admin...
Trying root...
Trying password123...
Success! Password found: password123
```

### üåê Subdomain Finder
```yaml
Enter domain: example.com

Finding subdomains for example.com...

Found subdomain: www.example.com
Found subdomain: mail.example.com
Found subdomain: admin.example.com

Found Subdomains Summary:
- www.example.com
- mail.example.com
- admin.example.com
```

##  Use Cases

  * Educational Labs: Practice attacks on DVWA, Metasploitable, OWASP Juice Shop, or custom vulnerable apps.

  * Security Training: Understand real-world enumeration and brute-force attack scenarios.

  * CTFs & Practice: Rapid testing of open ports and login attempts during Capture The Flag events.

  * Custom Expansion: Serve as a base framework to integrate more advanced tools (e.g., HTTP fuzzing, service detection, etc.).

‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Use this toolkit only on systems and networks you have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized usage may violate laws and ethical standards.
